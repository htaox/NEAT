### Node Elasticsearch Angular TBD

#### What is it?
Not a stack or framework.  More like an amusement park.
Think Disney World.  Magic Kingdom or Epcot, why not both?

Or not at all.

#### Mission
The goal of this project is to make open healthcare data useful.
Someone has to do it.  Why not you or me?

#### Let's brainstorm
NLP, fulltext search, recommendation engine, predictive analytics,
social graphs, patient relation graphs, and (your idea here) graphs!
